Tetrahedral numbers are essentially the 3-dimensional version of triangular numbers. To construct them, imagine stacking balls in a triangular pyramid, as shown:

In fact, we can directly construct tetrahedral numbers as a sum of triangular numbers! Let the $n$-th tetrahedral and $n$-th triangular numbers be denoted as $V_n$ and $T_n$, respectively.
